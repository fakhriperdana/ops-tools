# ops-tools
Tools, Script, or Snippet that are used to ease and improve the process of operations in server (Linux/Unix-like)

Disclaimer: I never claimed all of these scripts are made by me. Some of them I found on the internet, some I made it myself, or sometimes both when I need to tweak to my needs.
